# yeast-starvation

## Introduction

The data and MATLAB and Python code used for analysis and figure generation of Yeast starvation project is provided here. All the MATLAB code was written in version 2018a

If using any of the data or code, please cite the following article:

## The parts
This Github is divided as follows:
* targeted-intracellular - All the data and code used to plot intracellular metabolites over time in Figure 1bc
* untargeted-extracellular - All the data and code used to plot extracellular metabolites over time in Figure 2a
* metabolite-map-plot - The code used to make the metabolic map (Figure 3b)
* fast-untargeted-intracellular - All data and code used to plot the rapid untargeted metabolomics data (Figures 3ce, Figure 5a, and S2ab)
* fast-targeted-intracellular - All data and code used to plot the rapid targeted metabolomics data (Figure 3d)
* lipidomics - All the data and code used to generate Figures 5cd
